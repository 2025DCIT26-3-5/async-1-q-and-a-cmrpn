# Component-Based Architecture  

## What does “component-based” mean in React?  

## React applications are built using small, reusable components that represent parts of the user interface. Each component manages its own logic, structure, and styling, making complex UIs easier to maintain and scale.  


# Declarative Programming Paradigm  

## How does React use declarative programming?  

## React lets developers describe *what* the UI should look like based on a given state, not *how* to manipulate the DOM. React automatically updates the UI when the state changes, keeping the view consistent and predictable.  


# State-Driven UI Architecture  

## What does it mean that React’s UI is “state-driven”?  

## React components re-render automatically when their state or props change. This makes the UI dynamic and responsive — always reflecting the latest data or user interactions without manual DOM updates.  


# JavaScript Library Architecture  

## Is React a framework or a library, and what does that mean?  

## React is a **JavaScript library**, not a full framework. It focuses only on the *view layer* of an application, but can be paired with tools like React Router, Redux, or Next.js to build complete web apps.  


# Industry Adoption & Ecosystem  

## How widely is React used in the tech industry?  

## React is one of the most widely used front-end technologies. Companies like Meta, Netflix, Airbnb, and Spotify use it for production applications. Its vast ecosystem includes libraries and frameworks such as Next.js and React Native.  


# Meta Engineering & Open Source  

## Who created React, and how is it maintained today?  

## React was developed by **Meta (Facebook)** and is maintained as an **open-source project** supported by Meta engineers and a global community. It continues to evolve with regular updates and strong community contributions.
